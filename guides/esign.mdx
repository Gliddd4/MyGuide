## Installing E-Sign's ipa

To install E-Sign on your iDevice you can use KravaSigner, a website that allows you to import your certificate for the purpose of installing .ipa files. Please note dxsign is NOT affiliated with KravaSign in any way.

To start go to this link

```
https://ipasign.pro/
```

On the website, click **Select IPA File** then select **ESignV5.0_noLogs_V1.1.ipa** in the file browser. This will upload the E-Sign IPA to the web signer.

After that, import your mobile provision and .p12 file you obtained from dxsign.cc, and type in the password given within the file "password" in the folder you downloaded from dxsign. Common passwords are 1234 and abcdefg, but to be sure open your files and tap on the file, where it will then show you your password.

After importing that, click upload and sign.

After that click install when prompted again, and move on to the next step after it completes installing and appears on your home screen.

## Sign your IPA

Click the three dots in the top bar, then select **Import**. Upload all the IPA files you want to sign.

![Import IPAs](/images/esign/import.jpeg)

If your imported IPA files are in .zip format, click the info icon, select Rename, and remove the ".zip" extension. This happens because Safari automatically converts .ipa files to .zip format.

You should now see your app in the Unsigned tab. Click on the IPA file you want to sign, then select **Signature**.
