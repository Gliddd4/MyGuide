## Blocking Revokes

Next we are going to install a DNS to block revokes. First open this link in your Safari browser. Expect a popup to appear asking you to allow the [configuration profile](https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/malicious-configuration-profiles-ios-achilles-heel/). **Click allow** then **open the settings app**.

**In the settings app, click profile downloaded**, **then click install**. 

You can **confirm the DNS is installed by opening Settings \> General \> VPN** and seeing the profile called.

<Accordion title="Are configuration profiles safe?" icon="question" iconType="regular">
  <Note>
    Not really. They can monitor your web traffic and redirect you to malicous websites in Safari. Pleae only use configurations from trusted sources.

## Downloading Feather

**Download the .ipa for Feather below** on your iDevice. **Confirm you downloaded the .ipa and not the .tipa.**

```
https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/
```

<Accordion title="Whats a .tipa? Is iOS 17 or iOS 18 jailbreakable?" icon="question" iconType="regular">
  <Note>
    [**TIPA files**](https://fileinfo.com/extension/tipa) are IPA files that only work for [**TrollStore**](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/).

    TrollStore supports iOS 14.0 Beta 2 to iOS 16.7 RC. It also supports iOS 17.0 exclusively.

    If you are on a supported TrollStore version, follow this [tutorial](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/).
  </Note>
  <Warning>
    There is no jailbreak for iOS 17 or iOS 18. Any [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=iOS+18+jailbreak) claiming this is scam. The only device that can be jailbroken on iOS 17 & 18 is the [iPad 7](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111911).

    If you have a **iPad 7** and want to jailbreak, follow this [tutorial](https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started/iPad-\(7th-generation\).html) or this more detailed [tutorial](https://docs.website-msw.pages.dev/docs/intro/). After jailbreaking with palera1n you can get TrollStore Lite [here](https://havoc.app/package/trollstorelite).

    If the tutorial is too difficult for you, I don't recommend jailbreaking since you end up doing more harm then good. Jailbreak support is available in the [r/jailbreak](https://discord.com/invite/jb) server.
