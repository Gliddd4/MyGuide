## Downloading Feather

Download the latest release of [Feather](http://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/) from the releases page on their [GitHub](https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/) below. Make sure you **download the .ipa** and **not the .tipa**.

```
https://github.com/khcrysalis/Feather/releases/
```

<Note>
  [**TIPA files**](https://fileinfo.com/extension/tipa) are IPA files that only work for [**TrollStore**](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/). TrollStore supports iOS 14.0 Beta 2 to iOS 16.7 RC. It also supports iOS 17.0 exclusively.

  If you are on a supported version, follow this [tutorial](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/).
</Note>

<Warning>
  There is no jailbreak for iOS 17 or iOS 18.

  Any [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=iOS+18+jailbreak) claiming this is scam.

  The only device that can be jailbroken on iOS 17 & 18 is the [iPad 7](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111911).

  If you have a iPad 7 and want to jailbreak, follow this [tutorial](https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started/iPad-\(7th-generation\).html) or this more detailed [tutorial](https://docs.website-msw.pages.dev/docs/intro/). If you are confused on how to install palera1n, ask in the [r/jailbreak discord](https://discord.com/invite/jb). After jailbreaking with palera1n you can get TrollStore Lite [here](https://havoc.app/package/trollstorelite).

Uploading your certificate

After that, import your mobile provision and .p12 file you obtained from dxsign.cc, and type in the password given within the file "password" in the folder you downloaded from dxsign. Common passwords are 1234 and abcdefg, but to be sure open your files and tap on the file, where it will then show you your password.
