The only device that can be jailbroken on iOS 17+ is the [iPad 7](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111911).

After that, import your mobile provision and .p12 file you obtained from dxsign.cc, and type in the password given within the file "password" in the folder you downloaded from dxsign. Common passwords are 1234 and abcdefg, but to be sure open your files and tap on the file, where it will then show you your password.

After importing that, click upload and sign.
