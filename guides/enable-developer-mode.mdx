<Warning>
  Enabling developer mode will **reduce security**, as noted in Apple's Documentation https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device.
  However, **you won't notice a difference** + its required to sideload.
</Warning>

Open the **Settings App** and **scroll down** until you see **Privacy & Security**. Click that.

Now **scroll to the bottom** of **Privacy & Security**, where you'll see the Developer Mode option. When you turn it on, you will be prompted to restart your device (iOS 18+).
